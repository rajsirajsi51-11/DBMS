# Experiment 4: SQL JOIN Operations

**Name:** RAJSI RAWAT
**UID:** 24BET10074

## Aim

To practice SQL JOIN operations across multiple tables and display the required results.

## Problem Statements

1. List `customer_name` and `order_date` for all customers who have placed orders.
2. List all customer names and their corresponding `product_name`, including customers who have not placed any orders.
3. Display `product_name` and `order_date` for all products that are ordered.
4. Perform a `FULL OUTER JOIN` on `student` and `course` tables using `Course_id`.

## SQL Queries Used

### 1) Customers and Order Dates

```sql
select cust.customer_name, od.order_date
from customers as cust
inner join orders as od
on cust.customer_id = od.customer_id;
```

### 2) All Customers with Products (Including Customers with No Orders)

```sql
select cust.customer_name, p.product_name
from customers as cust
left join orders as od
on cust.customer_id = od.customer_id
left join products p
on od.product_name = p.product_name;
```

### 3) Products and Their Order Dates

```sql
select p.product_name, od.order_date
from products as p
inner join orders as od
on p.product_name = od.product_name;
```

### 4) FULL OUTER JOIN on Student and Course

```sql
select *
from student
full outer join course
on student.Course_id = course.Course_id;
```
